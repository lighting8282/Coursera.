GDD tips: 
Overall:
1.) For conjure army, only have ghost and phantom guardian. Skele is fine but just about everyone took out skele and zombie from conjure army. At the very least, take out
ZOMBIE! 
2.) Panick eat if you have too. Food was never an issue in my runs. Barricade if you have too. Do w/e to stay alive. 

FOR BM:
1.) Pretty straightforward just watch goebies and voke airuts if needed.
2.) BUSC can do south gong and pet 1 tank can do west gong
3.) Just be mindful of pet 2 and pet 3 health. Since everyone will have reflect prayers, means we are more likely to finish off a prayer if health gets too low after bombs.
4.) Pet tanks should try to get pets health down to 6-8k range instead of 10k+ range. Makes it easier to finish both pets off in one wave.
5.) NO SKULLS OR DEATHMARKING UNTIL BM IS THE ONLY ONE LEFT ALIVE!



FOR YAKA: 
1.) SLOW AND STEADY
2.) ATN SUCKS
3.) Wherever the special JW brings the jellies, anyone near the 2 closest pools will stop using skulls,threads, gchain, any strong AOE. I lost a run because special JW was south side
and someone from shark uses skulls. Skulls bounced from shark to sh10 to tendrils pool to jelly, back to tendrils, then back to jelly to kill it. 
4.) I will be doing calls throughout as usual, BUT! If you need to call out something that will stop us from ending the run, then please talk over me/anyone!
